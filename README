# Project1 - HTTP Server
COP4635 - System & Networks 2
Team Members: Devan Rivera, Ashley Villegas

## Project Description
This project implements a multi-threaded HTTP server in C++. The server dynamically assigns a port between 60001-60099, handles HTTP GET requests, and serves HTML and image files. 

It correctly returns:
- 200 OK for valid files.
- 404 Not Found for missing files.
- 400 Bad Request for unsupported HTTP methods.

The server runs indefinitely until manually stopped and supports multiple clients simultaneously using multithreading.


**Required Files**
Make sure the following files are included in your project directory:
- index.html
- makefile
- img.jpg
- server.cpp
- testPresence.html


## Running the Program (Using SSH Client)
Step 1: compile the makefile
        Comand: make

        ~ If there are any errors, 
          Run: make clean and rerun make

Step 2: Once compile run executable
        Executable: ./httpServer

Step 3: (Using Local Machine) - Find the URL and implement into a browser
        URL: http://localhost:<PORT#>
        Example: http://localhost:6783

        (Using Remote Server (via SSH)) - 
            1. The port number will be given
                Example: Server running on port: 60093

            1. Find your serverâ€™s IP: 
                Command: hostname -I
                Example: 143.88.68.24

            2. Then use http://<SERVER_IP>:<PORT#> on the browser
                Example: http://143.88.68.24:6783

Step 4: Test the links

Step 5: Once your done, to stop the server
        press Ctrl + C
